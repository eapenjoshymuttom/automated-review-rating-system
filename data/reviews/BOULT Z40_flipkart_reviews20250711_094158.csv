Click Tt,4,Pretty good,"Product is good . Sound quality is balanced everyy type of instrument is well defined in songs . But I 1 cons maybe it's only with me becz I am using my first tws with ANC . I think the ANC mode seems useless I like transparency mode better than ANC feature , Also it's gaming mode doesn't feel like 45 ms . It feels like 60 ms .Battery backup is so impressive with charging case as I am using it from two days seemlessly .READ MORE",Click Tt,Yes,1

Flipkart Customer,3,Good,I am rating this one after 12 days of use. Over-all it's good.- main thing is that the RGB light is taking more charge it's obvious.- and the case charging time is more than 2hrs.- while using both buds at a time some time it's getting one-sided. Like in one side is louder than the other.Over-all it's better according to price range of 1100 but when it's 1500 and above then don't go for it - dual connectivity is fine but somehow it's unstable- Now am editing this after 1month of use and...READ MORE,Flipkart Customer,Yes,5

Utkarsh  Singh,4,Good quality product,"Works well, but built quality could have been better like the boult w40. Mor over the design of lid is annoying, because you can't take out the earbudss using one hand while resting the case on something. The moment you rest the opened case on the table it closes. It requires both hands to take out the buds. Boult k40/w40 were better in these aspectsREAD MORE",Utkarsh  Singh,Yes,1

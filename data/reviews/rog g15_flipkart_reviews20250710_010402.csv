Rajarshi  Chanda,5,Best Gaming Laptop at 75k!!!! BUT beware of EKART!,"This Laptop is one of the best budget-friendly gaming laptop that is currently available.

Vipin Kundnani,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This Laptop ASUS ROG Strix G15, I bought for my son who is learning Coding and gaming and he's so satisfied from my this gift to him. He admires that ASUS delivered whatever it committed at the time of purchase. He uses the laptop for 4-5 hrs continuously but it doesn't warms at all. The machine responds so well and fast while playing heavy games. Battery backup is also good, build quality is so fine, and the cosmetic looks like the Logo, the RGB lights, etc increases the confidence when use ...READ MORE",Vipin Kundnani,Yes,20

Adarsh  M C,5,Excellent,"Performance : Amazing and it is very fast because of SDD. But I did feel that 512GB storage is not sufficient when you consider that you have to maintain some free space in C drive without utilising it to maintain fast responsiveness from the laptop.Memory : 8GB is really good and is going to be enough if you are casual gamer. However, if you love to play many games and work at the same time by keeping tabs or applications open the you might have to consider buying additional 8GB RAM. One m...READ MORE",Adarsh  M C,Yes,670
